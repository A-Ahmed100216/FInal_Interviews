# What is DevOps?

* DevOps bridges the gap between development and operations teams enabling them to **work closer together**, **share responsibility**, **deploy infrastructure as a code**, and **automate the pipeline**.
* Development team builds products which they will deploy to development environment where they can check integration as well as other aspects.
* Developers are responsible for new product features, bug fixes, security updates and code refactoring. The issues lies in the fact that development environments do not fully reflect the production environment therein leading to errors and warnings.
* Meanwhile, operations teams are responsible for managing services, ensuring services and products are running correctly, monitoring, and growing capacity as per product or company needs. Similar to development, team operations teams face errors when deploying.
* Prior to the formation of DevOps, the two teams worked separately facing a lot of errors and not enough speed. The main facet of DevOps is to break these silos down and have the two work much closer together, share responsibilities, deploy infrastructure as a code, and automate the pipeline. This leads to greater efficiency, provided they are supported by good engineering practices. These are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment CI/CD.
* **Continuous Integration** - We have development team building products, writing tests and storing code in a source control system for collaborative purposes.
* **Continuous delivery** -The next step is to engage with the operations team and deploy onto on-premise or on the cloud utilising infrastructure as a code. Continuous Integration is also maintained by using GitHub for version control and collaboration. Also, at this stage, a CI/CD server can be introduced to automatically monitor changes to the GitHub and run as required. Once tests have been passed, we move to a pre-production environment and conduct the same tests to ensure quality throughout.
* **Continuous Deployment** - Combining the previous practices and running tests all the way through to production. Ultimately, this leads to faster time to market, improved team collaboration, continuous release cycles, automate, scalable environments, and increased quality due to automated testing

## 4 Pillars of DevOps
1. Ease of Use
2. Flexibility
3. Robustness
4. Cost

# DevOps Lifecycle 
Continuous Development --> Continuous Testing --> Continuous Integration --> Continuous Deployment --> Continuous Delivery --> Continuous Monitoring
