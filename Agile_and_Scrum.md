# Agile

## What is Agile?
* Agile is a project management methodology which focusses upon an iterative approach.
* The Agile Manifesto which details the values and principles around which Agile centres.
* Agile has 12 principles which can be collated under 4 values.These values are:
  * Individuals and Interaction over processes and tools – Promoting team cohesion
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation – Focussing upon the building and testing rather than creating large documents. This is reflected in the practice of creating Epics and User Stories which typically summate tasks on a single sticky note, as opposed to swathes of documentation.
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation – Involving the customer in the process.
  * Responding to change over following a plan – Being flexible and adaptable.

## What is Scrum
Scrum is a framework used to apply methodologies such as Agile. It replaces traditional algorithmic frameworks which tend to prioritise efficiency over value. However, SCRUM is designed to be more reflective of the people and the organisation therefore more flexible to meet the ever-changing needs and complexities of projects.
The image below is commonly used to illustrate the Scrum framework.

### Scrum Roles
Product Owner - They represent the customers and stakeholders and a responsible for driving the product backlog. This is an ordered, dynamic list of everything that is to be completed during the course of the project.
Scrum Master - The leader of the scrum, responsible for making sure scrum is understood and implemented. They help the team understand the theory, practices and rules associated with Scrum.
Development Team – A self-organising and cross-functional team with no titles or sub-teams. The development team is responsible for accomplishing the tasks set out in the product backlog.


### Scrum Ceremonies
Sprint Planning Meeting – This meeting is to discuss the overall project objective and ask questions such as “What are we going to work on and how are we going to do it?”. This information is then broken down into smaller increments which can be complemented in a sprint. The team will identify what tasks they wish to complete in the forthcoming sprint. The workload is typically sufficient for two days of work.
Daily Scrum – This is a daily meeting, typically time-boxed to 15 minutes. It is organised by the scrum master. Typical questions will include ‘What has been done on the previous day?’ and ‘What needs to be done today?’. The aim of this is to ensure transparency as to what each team member has done and synchronise teamwork.
Sprint review- This is conducted at the end of each sprint and stakeholders are invited to collectively review the sprint which has just been completed. The aim is to gain feedback and evaluate whether the increment has been delivered to meet the definition of done. Thus, questions would pertain to ‘what has been completed during this sprint?’ Feedback is then put back into the product backlog.
Sprint retrospective – This ceremony occurs after the completion of a sprint and is typically timeboxed to 90 minutes. It allows the team to evaluate how well they worked and build a plan for improvement. Question asked include, ‘What went well?’, ‘What did not go well?’, and ‘What can be improved?’. The Scrum ceremonies are designed to incorporate the values of agile, by creating an atmosphere which promotes collaboration through daily scrum, transparency via sprint backlogs ceremonies such as the sprint planning meeting and sprint review, which allows stakeholders to attend and review alongside the development team. The sprint retrospective promotes continuous improvement which is another agile principle.

### Scrum Artifacts
Scrum artifacts enable the scrum team and stakeholders to understand the development of the product and identify what tasks have been completed and what is yet to be completed. There are 3 main artifacts. These are:

Product Backlog – This is an ordered list of everything that is to be completed in a project. This includes features, functions tests and requirements of the product. This list is dynamic therefore constantly evolving throughout the project.
Sprint Backlog – The sprint backlog contains everything that is to be completed in ag given sprint as well as a plan for delivering the increment.
Increment – This is the sums of all the product backlog item completed during the sprint, and all previous sprints. The increment must meet the ‘Definition of Done’ (DOD) at the end of a sprint. The Definition of Done is a predefined acceptance criterion which each product backlog item must meet. Theoretically each increment should be potentially releasable if it has met the DOD. Tools such as Trello allow for the implementation of scrum artifacts as a board can be created to categorise the product backlog, sprint backlog and a done column to represent the increment.


## 3 Amigos

The 3 amigos refer to a practice in Agile wherein the aim is to bridge departments in the company. This allows for a more holistic Definition of Done. The 3 amigos are typically:

The Business Analyst – They make sure everyone understands the user stories and has the same expectations.
Developers – They are responsible for requirements so will discuss their understanding of these.
Tester – They will try to find edge cases to enhance the testing process.

## User Stories and Epics
User Stories are a practice which enables agile users to move away from simply writing about requirements and end features, to having a discussion about them. They typically follow the following format: As a , I want , so that A benefit of user stories is the ability to write varying levels of details. However, larger user stories are typically defined as epic stories. Epic stories are large user stories which are too large to be completed in one iteration. Thus, these can be broken down into smaller user stories. Epic stories follow the same template as a user story. INVEST is an acronym used to ensure the user story is of a high quality. Failure to meet one of these is often followed by a reword or rewrite of the user story. The criterion is as follows:

Independent
Negotiable
Valuable
Estimable
Small
Testable
User stories can be used with Planning Poker. This is an Agile technique used to estimate the product backlog. It is used to reach a consensus about the order of the backlog after discussion of a user story.
User and Epic Stories fit in with Agile as they are a part of the Agile approach. Epic Stories are large tasks which are then broken into user stories. A user story is the smallest unit of work and fit well into the Scrum framework which is typically used to accomplish Agile methodology. The practice of condensing a user story into an index card or sticky note (or online alternative) allows the user story to easily transition between product backlog and sprint backlog where they can be added as an activity to be completed within a given sprint.


## Kanban
Kanban is another framework used to implement Agile. It hinges on communication and transparency with all work items represented on a Kanban board.
Like Scrum, Kanban is an Agile framework but where Scrum focusses upon ceremonies, artifacts and roles, Kanban is somewhat simpler with the Kanban board being the centre. Kanban is designed to maximise efficiency whereas Scrum centres upon continuous improvement.
