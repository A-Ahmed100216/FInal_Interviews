# What is OOP?
* Object Oriented Programming is a programming practice which organises objects into classes.
* Collating data and storing as an objects. Objects are defined using the class keyword and in this we define variables which are known as attribute, and functions , i.e. methods
* 4 Pillars:
1. Encapsulation - separating from other parts of code
2. Abstraction - extension of encapsulation - isolates method and properties from outside code to reduce complexity.
3. Inheritance - Eliminate redundant code
4. Polymorphism - Many forms refactor code to make it more efficient


# What is TDD?
* Test Driven development
* Practice of writing test for specific functionalities prior to the functionality existing
* Write test, check test, test fails, write functionality, tests passes
* Why?
  * identifies bugs early on
  * Drives focused on specific functionalities
  * Some practitioners believe it leads to higher quality.
  * Cleaner code
